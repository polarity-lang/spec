\subsection{Overview}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In \cref{sec:syntax} we present the syntax of expressions.
    \item In \cref{sec:normalization} we present the untyped normalization-by-evaluation algorithm used to normalize terms.
    \item In \cref{sec:unification} we present the unification algorithm which computes unifications.
    \item In \cref{sec:typeinference} we present the bidirectional type inference algorithm used to check and infer types.
